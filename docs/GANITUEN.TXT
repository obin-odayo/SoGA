Encode your questions below.  Indicate as well the algorithm(s) to be used in answering each question.
Questions with parameter(s) should have the parameter(s) encoded in angled brackets, for example, <parameter-name>. 

Q1: What are the names and values of the top <num> countries with the highest <category>?
    Remark, output must be double with 5 significant units.
    [algorithm(s): selection sort, maximum]

Q2: What are the numbers of countries, minimum, maximum, and average values for <category>? 
    [algorithm(s): count, minimum, maximum, and average]
    Remarks.    for minimum, maximum, and average have 8 significant figures.

Q3: Given the first <num> countries below the average for <category>. What country is the median in that set? 
    [algorithm(s): selection sort, average, count]

Q4: Given the data sorted in descending order for <category> what are the countries above and below the data of <country>.
    [algorithm(s): selection sort, linear search]
    Remarks.    Say the rank of the country in the category (when sorted in descending order) is the nth rank. So, the 
                country above it is the (n-1)th rank and the country below it is the (n+1)th rank.
                
Q5: In <category>, what is the position of <country>'s data value if is sorted in increasing order?
    [algorithm(s): selection sort, binary search]
