	Fix all warnings.  Do NOT run the program if you still have a warning.  You must have
	0 error, 0 warning before running the program.
	   
	Run the resulting a.exe file in the command line with input and output (I/O) redirection.

/* 
	HARD REQUIREMENTS: NON-COMPLIANCE WILL MAKE YOUR SOLUTION INCORRECT or CAUSE POINT DEDUCTIONS!
	
	1. You must apply arrays and strings in MP Part 1 (MP1).
    2. Document your codes with SENSIBLE comments.
    3. Use double data type (not float) for all floating point 
       values/variables/functions/return type
    4. Do NOT use any global variables.
    5. Do NOT call printf() except inside the main() function.
    6. Do NOT use the following yet this MP.
        a. struct data type
	    b. file processing functions such as fopen(), fclose(), etc.
	7. Do NOT use library functions that were NOT discussed in our class.

/*
    You may declare any typedef that you need below this comment.

/*
    Define any function that you need below this comment.  

    The following should be included as comments and appear BEFORE EACH function definition:
       a. Purpose: describe succintly what the function is supposed to accomplish.
       b. Parameters: describe succintly the nature/purpose of each parameter.
       c. Return type: if the function is not void, describe succintly what it will return as a result.          

    For functions that serve as answers to the questions, include the following as comments
    BEFORE the function definition itself:
       a. Question number, and the actual question.
       b. Thereafter, type the answer number, and the corresponding expected answer.
    
    For example: 
      Q1:  Which country has the lowest baseline life expectancy?
      A1:  Lesotho

    Document the body of the function by including comments alongside codes that you think
    may not be easy to understand to the person reading the codes. 
*/

 Q1  

int
main()
{
    /* Declare your own local variables. Describe the purpose of your local variables. */

    printf("%lf", china[0]);
    
    /* 
       Call the function that answers a question. Thereafter, use printf() to print the question 
       and the corresponding answer.  For example:

       expectancy = Q1_Answer(territory, param_x, param_y); // where expectancy, territory, param_x and param_y are local variables.

       printf("Q1: Which territory has the lowest baseline life expectancy?\n");
       printf("A1: %s %lf\n", territory, expectancy);       

       TEST CASES HARD REQUIREMENTS:
       You should have multiple test cases, i.e., functions calls to answer those 
       Questions that involve parameter(s).  There should be function calls with
       different actual paramete values.  For questions that require searching
       (linear or binary search), there should be a test case, i.e., a  function 
       call with a search key parameter that does not exist, i.e., NOT FOUND scenario.
